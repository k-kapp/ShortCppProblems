# ShortCppProblems
A collection of my solutions to shorter C++ problems from various websites. Will keep on updating indefinitely (hopefully!).

This repository contains various small programming problems solved in C++. They are organised as follows

+ problems on www.hackerrank.com in the folder `hackerrank`
+ Assignments from postgraduate CS courses. Note, the CS course and university is not specified, and the actual assignment number not specified. The assignment was also modified, so that it bears no resemblance (at least in terms of keywords) to the original assignment. This is to prevent plagiarism, in case the lecturer uses the same assignment for future classes.
