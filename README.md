# ShortCppProblems

This repository contains various small programming problems solved in C++. They are organised as follows

+ Problems on www.hackerrank.com in the folder `hackerrank`
+ Small projects inspired by material from postgraduate CS courses. At the moment only one such project has been added - the code of the other projects is being cleaned and updated.
+ Other small programs that do not fit into either of the two categories above, in the folder `misc`.
