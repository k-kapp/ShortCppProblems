# ShortCppProblems
A collection of my solutions to shorter C++ problems from various websites. Will keep on updating indefinitely (hopefully!).

This repository contains various small programming problems solved in C++. They are organised as follows

+ Problems on www.hackerrank.com in the folder `hackerrank`
+ Small projects inspired by assignments from postgraduate CS courses. Note, the CS course and university are not specified, and neither is the actual assignment number. Each assignment was also modified heavily (hence the use of the word "inspired"), so that it bears very little resemblance to the original assignment. This is obviously to prevent plagiarism, in case the lecturer uses the same assignment for future classes.
+ Other small programs that do not fit into either of the two categories above.
