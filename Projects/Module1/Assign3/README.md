Implementation of a generalised genetic algorithm. The user of this program may specify from the command line the population size, number of dimensions and stopping criteria.
From within the source code, the user may specify which crossover and mutation operators to use, as well as any objective function (as long as the signature of the objective function is correct).

Plots are also drawn for the values of each variable, for the top n individuals in the population at each iteration. This is shown below.

TODO:

+ Allow user to specify via command line arguments the type of crossover and mutation operators are desired.
+ Allow user to specify own crossover and mutation functions (and pass these to constructor of GA).

Plots example:
