#Algorithms

I plan to put implementations of some common algorithms here, such as sorting and string processing algorithms.

Note that I DO NOT simply read pseudocode from a textbook and implement it in C++. Instead, I do some reading on how the algorithm works conceptually, then write the code in C++. I also try to make the algorithm as efficient as possible in some way (such as in the mergesort algorithm I keep the memory use as low as possible).

So far I have:

+ `mergesort.cpp` contains a memory-efficient, procedural implementation of the mergesort algorithm
