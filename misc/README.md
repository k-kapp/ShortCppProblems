Miscellaneous little programs written in C++. So far, I have two programs that can convert from decimal to binary and to hexadecimal (`get_binary.cpp` and `get_hex.cpp`, respectively). 

The folder `data_struc` contains implementations of various data structures (navigate to that folder for more detailed descriptions of each data structure implemented).
