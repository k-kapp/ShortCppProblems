Implement a simple "text editor", with the following capabilities:

Initially, the editor contains an empty string S. The following four operations must be supported:

1. append (W): append a string W to the end of S.
2. delete (k): remove the last k characters from S.
3. print (k): print the kth character of S to the screen.
4. undo(): undo the last (not previously undone) operation of type 1 or 2, reverting S to what it was before the operation was performed.
